# fire_login

This is a showcase of Flutters plugins that allow Google and Firebase user authentication.

The application follows an authentication process of:

         /---Homepage
Main----Root
         \\---Login

Where the Root determains whether a user is logged in/out and decides what screen to display to the user.
